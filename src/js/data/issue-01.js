It has enough preservatives in it to be left out for just one night without spoiling, right? But how damaging are the preservatives to my body? How do they preserve mayo? Should preservatives in food be legal? Are we weaker because of them? Should I make my own mayo? I should be making my own mayo. I’m going to make my own mayo. Oh no. My eggs have gone bad."

I may be hiding those parts unconsciously but my dreams surfaced them more than anything."

What I found was that in fact many of my dreams do center around spaces, so I wanted to create a diagram that helped me see patterns in those locations.<br/><br/>Each dream is represented as a circle, where its size is based on the number of lines I wrote about that dream, and it’s fill is darkened based on the time I spent asleep, which ranged from 4 to 10.5 hours. The dream circles are nested within larger circles representing categories of location. At the top level the dreams are split about evenly between indoor and outdoor locations, with a smaller number that were ambiguous or involved moving between the two. Finally, a line traces through the dreams in chronological order.<br/><br/>Interestingly, after especially long nights of sleep I seem to write in more detail about dreams involving interior spaces, but less about dreams involving exterior locations."

I walk to the stable and enter through a small wooden entrance. I look up, and see a black horse, black until it runs towards me, rearing a little in its joy. Then its coat changes into a deep dark brown as it shimmers in the sun. It’s been years of separation and I’m overjoyed to see that he has remembered me, and so fondly approaches.<br/><br/>I return to the stable entrance and ask an older woman, blond hair greying, for something sweet to add to my horse’s feed. She hands me a plastic bag of dried cranberries that are catered towards diabetics. It’s all she has, she says, so I take it despite my misgivings about whether it’s healthy for horses to eat. I then turn around and grab an ornate saddle, returning outside.<br/><br/>We have been thrown together, both launched high up into the air as if by a springboard. We land on our sides onto a field of red-gold, a freshly harvested field of wheat. The rows have been shorn short, golden tufts lining ochre red earth. We have landed face to face and I know that things are irreparable now. I look at the black horse, its coat dark brown revealed by the rays of the sun, and I cry.<br/><br/>If this is the end, together and from doing what we both love most, then it is a beautiful way to die."
