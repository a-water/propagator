The dream circles are nested within larger circles, which represent categories of location. At the top level, the dreams are split almost evenly between indoor and outdoor locations, with a smaller number that were either ambiguous or involved moving between the two. Finally, a line traces through the dreams in chronological order.<br/><br/>Interestingly, after especially long nights of sleep I seem to write about dreams involving interior spaces in more detail, but less about dreams involving exterior locations."

Then its coat changes into a deep dark brown as it shimmers in the sun. It’s been years of separation and I’m overjoyed to see that he has remembered me, and so fondly approaches.<br/><br/>I return to the stable entrance and ask an older woman, blond hair greying, for something sweet to add to my horse’s feed. She hands me a plastic bag of dried cranberries that are catered towards diabetics. It’s all she has, she says, so I take it despite my misgivings about whether it’s healthy for horses to eat. I then turn around and grab an ornate saddle, returning outside.<br/><br/>We have been thrown together, both launched high up into the air as if by a springboard. We land on our sides onto a field of red-gold, a freshly harvested field of wheat. The rows have been shorn short, golden tufts lining ochre red earth. We have landed face to face and I know that things are irreparable now. I look at the black horse, its coat dark brown revealed by the rays of the sun, and I cry.<br/><br/>If this is the end, together and from doing what we both love most, then it is a beautiful way to die."
